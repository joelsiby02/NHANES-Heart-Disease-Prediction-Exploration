The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset is a comprehensive dataset that contains information on the health and lifestyle behaviors of participants in the survey. The dataset from 2013-2014 includes variables and measures related to demographics, physical measurements, dietary intake, physical activity, chronic conditions, and environmental exposures.

NHANES is a nationally representative survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assess the health and nutritional status of the U.S. population. The survey uses a complex, multistage sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

The NHANES dataset is widely used by researchers, public health professionals, and policymakers to inform health policy, develop public health interventions, and track trends in health and lifestyle behaviors over time. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) website.

Overall, the NHANES dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the health and lifestyle behaviors of the U.S. population, and it provides a rich source of data for developing interventions to improve public health.
