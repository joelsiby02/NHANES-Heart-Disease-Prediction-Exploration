# NHANES Dataset Analysis for Model Building

This project is an analysis of the NHANES dataset, a complex survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The goal of this project is to learn about model building by trying out various models and comparing their performance on the dataset.

## Data

The NHANES dataset is a large, complex dataset that requires significant preprocessing and cleaning before it can be used for analysis. The dataset includes information on a wide range of variables, including demographics, medical history, laboratory test results, and more.

## Approach

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a patient having a heart disease based on several features such as age group, gender, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (ca), and thalassemia (thal).

The model uses a Decision Tree Classifier to make predictions, which means it builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including the probability of a patient having a heart disease. The following models were tried for this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
- Decision Trees Model
- Neural Networks Model
- Gradient Boosting Machines Model
- XGBoost Classifier Model

The performance of these models was evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting the likelihood of a patient having a heart disease using various features in the dataset.

## Results

The results of this project demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate models for a given task. The Decision Trees model was found to have the best accuracy, with a current accuracy of 0.31550068587105623. However, it is important to note that this accuracy may not be sufficient for real-world applications.

## Future Work

While this project provides a starting point for learning about model building, there is still a lot of work that can be done to improve the predictive power of the models. Some potential areas for future work include:

- Feature engineering to create more informative features from the existing data
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the selected models
- Ensembling methods to combine the predictions of multiple models
- Incorporating additional data sources to improve the predictive power of the models
